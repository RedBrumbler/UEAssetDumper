# Why this?

We wanted to get uncompressed UEAssets into a Human Readable Format that let us work with it further, so this tool reads uncompressed UEassets into a json representation so that it can be understood

# Compiling

Have cargo installed and then

```
git clone https://github.com/RedBrumbler/UEAssetReader.git
cd UEAssetReader
cargo build --release
```

# Credits
